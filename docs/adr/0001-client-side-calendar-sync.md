# Client-side calendar sync with token-in-memory

Google/Outlook calendar sync runs in the browser. Adapters call provider APIs
directly with a short-lived access token held in memory only. A separate OAuth
consent flow stores the refresh token server-side (encrypted AES-256-GCM); our
token endpoint (`/api/calendar/token`) decrypts and mints access tokens on demand.
Refresh token never touches the browser.

This keeps on-demand sync free — users spend their provider API quota, not ours.
That's the whole point of offering Google/Outlook to free users (background
auto-sync is the paid tier). Also avoids rewriting the existing adapters.

## Considered options

- **BFF token proxy** — token stays server-side; browser calls our endpoint.
  Rejected: every API call flows through our compute, killing the free-tier premise.
- **Server-side sync** — adapters in an edge function. Rejected: same compute cost,
  plus rewrite, and it adopts paid-tier economics before paid tier exists.

## Consequences

- Access token lives in browser memory for ~1h. Bounded by expiry, never persisted;
  XSS on a logged-in session can already hit our DB, so this is incremental risk.
  Compensate with CSP (Phase 61).
- Google/Outlook require login (OAuth needs server-anchored refresh token identity).
  Guests keep CalDAV with client credentials. Technical boundary, not paywall.

## Amended — CalDAV deferred at every tier

The CalDAV half of the last consequence no longer holds. The connect flow was
withdrawn pre-beta because it wrote server URL, username and password to
`localStorage` in plaintext, and it has not been rebuilt. No tier has CalDAV
today, so Guests do not have a calendar story at all — the "technical boundary,
not paywall" reasoning above still stands as intent, but describes something
that does not currently exist.

Rebuilding it is blocked on a genuine open question rather than effort: where a
credential lives when there is no account to anchor it to. In-memory-only works
for **WebDAV backup**, which is a deliberate button press, but not for calendar
sync, which fires on app open, window refocus and a post-edit debounce — a
Guest would be retyping a password several times a day, or the sync would simply
never run. Solving it means either a passphrase-derived key in the browser or
server-held credentials, and the second forecloses the Guest case that motivated
this decision. Deferred pending its own design pass.

The rest of this ADR — client-side adapters, token-in-memory, refresh token
server-side — is unaffected and still current for Google/Outlook.
