# Kanso

Kanso is a **Zen-Modernist** task management and focus tool. It fuses the Japanese philosophy of **Kanso** (simplicity) with **Modernism** to create a quiet, high-density environment for deep work.

## Key Workflows

### 1. Capture & Organize

- **Global Command Menu**: `Ctrl/Cmd + K` for instant search, navigation, and actions.
- **Micro & Macro Views**: Shift between **Masonry Grid**, **Board**, and **List** views instantly with `1/2/3`.
- **Split View**: Desktop List View automatically opens a master-detail split panel.
- **Project Structure**: Multi-layered project management with archiving and mobile-native drawers.
- **Group & Filter**: Group tasks by project, priority, or due date with full drag-and-drop across groups.

### 2. High-Fidelity Tracking

- **Habit Mastery**: Standardized habit tracking with haptic feedback, longevity tracking, and uhabits (.db) import support.
- **Activity Heatmap**: Track focus minutes and habit completions via a visual consistency chart.
- **Focus Timer**: PiP-enabled Pomodoro engine with real-time stats and background session detection.
- **Recurrence Modes**: Per-task Strict (anchor to due date) or Flexible (anchor to completion date) recurrence.

### 3. Calendar & Events

- **Native Event Creation**: Create calendar events directly from the calendar with an NLP-assisted time parser.
- **Multi-Provider Sync**: Bi-directional sync with Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and any CalDAV server (Nextcloud, iCloud, Fastmail).
- **ICS Portability**: Universal `.ics` (RFC 5545) import and export for full calendar portability.

### 4. Data Ownership & Sync

- **Guest / Private Mode**: A zero-footprint experience running entirely in `localStorage` — no account required.
- **WebDAV Sync**: Sync guest data with personal servers (Nextcloud, Synology) without an account.
- **Export / Import**: Universal `.zip` backups and `.ics` (RFC 5545) portability.
- **Account Data Sovereignty**: Registered users can export, import, or permanently delete all cloud data.
- **Offline-First PWA**: Full offline support via a service worker with stale-while-revalidate caching and a branded offline shell.

### 5. Preferences & Accessibility

- **Time Format**: System-wide 12-hour / 24-hour / system toggle applied across all time displays.
- **Keyboard Accessible**: Esc closes all open modals; full focus-trap and `aria-modal` audit completed.
- **Haptic Feedback**: "Seijaku" haptic pattern system for precise mobile feedback on all interactions.
